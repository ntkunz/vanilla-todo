# Vanilla Todo App

A simple todo app built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I'm creating this app as a personal project to run locally for now to keep track of daily and weekly tasks.

### Features

* Add, edit, and delete tasks
* Mark tasks as done or not done
* Set due dates for tasks
* Prioritize tasks
* Timer to track time spent on tasks
* Dark mode toggle

### Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

### Roadmap

* Add ability to filter tasks by due date, priority, and done status
* Add ability to add attachments to tasks
* Add ability to add tags to tasks
* Add ability to import and export tasks
* Add ability to sync tasks across devices
* Improve task timing UI
    - make available from collapsed task drawer
    - Allow editing tracked time
